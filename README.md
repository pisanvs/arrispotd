# Arris POTD

CLI Arris password of the day generator, made in pure C. Heavily based on (meaning i copied half
the code off of) [borfast/arrispwgen](https://github.com/borfast/arrispwgen), made it C because js = bloat
and also because i was bored.

## Installation

Run:

```bash
make
chmod 755 ./arrispotd
mv ./arrispotd /usr/local/bin/
```

## Special Thanks

@borfast for providing the algorithm
